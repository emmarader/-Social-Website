# Social-Website
First front-end project. Pulls the nearest restaurant, bars, parks and other social locations to display the real-time popularity of each location.

Social web page created to inform users in real- time of the most popular social spots within their desginated radius.
Using Google Map API users can check in at their location and drop a pin there, notify other friends of their current plans and what locations are hot.
This app is geared toward college students and young adults trying to figure out where to go on a night out. 
Social spots include restaurants, bars, parks, concert halls, and more!
